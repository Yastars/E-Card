E-Card game in python by Yassine Qassar
First time I saw this game it was in an Anime named Kaiji, I relly loved the idea so I decided to devlop it using python.


About the game:
The game starts with a simple interface in which the player will have to wait for the connection of another player to start the game, 
after the connection of the latter the game begins by distributing the cards specified for each player. 
Then the game begins, It's a two-player game that uses cards. Players play three times on the "emperor" side and the "slave" side. 
It is played with a total of ten cards; eight citizens, an emperor and a slave.
The game starts with each player having five cards, including four citizens and the last being a slave or an emperor. 
Who holds which card is decided in advance, and is played like this for three rounds before passing. 
The game lasts twelve rounds in total, which means that each team can play Emperor twice. 
Players choose a card from their hand (the Emperor side being the first) and place it face down on the table. 
They are then returned to reveal the winner of the match. The three types of cards are Citizen, Emperor and Slave.

The Citizen card represents the common man and can not defeat the emperor who sits at the top. He can, however, defeat the slave, 
who resides at the bottom of the system. Two citizens against each other give rise to equality.
The emperor represents the one at the top of society. This card can defeat the citizen, but will lose to the slave.
The slave is presented as the one at the bottom of society. Seeing that she has nothing to lose, she can overthrow the Emperor in a last 
attempt at revenge. This card will be lost against a citizen, but will prevail against the emperor's card.
When the slave or emperor card comes into play, the turn is over. The one on the side of the emperor is more likely to win, 
since the opponent has only one card capable of defeating the emperor. If the emperor is played against a citizen, his side wins the round.
The slave side, however, has only one chance to win; Play the Slave card when the opponent plays the Emperor. 
Since we can not know which card was played by the opponent until both have distributed it, the slave side has only one in five chances 
of winning, while the emperor side has the advantage with its 4/5.
